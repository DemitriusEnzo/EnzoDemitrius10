### Hello,

I am Enzo Demitrius, a Systems Information student with a focus on Full-Stack development.  
In my projects, I've explored technologies such as Node.js, Express, React.js, and more to build efficient APIs and dynamic front-end interfaces.

I'm currently working on **DemitriusBox-Server** and **DemitriusBox**, striving to enhance them by adding new features and improving their functionality.

I'm currently learning **Java**, focusing on deepening my understanding of object-oriented programming, logical problem-solving, and applying these skills in building robust applications.
